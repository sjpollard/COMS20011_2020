## Structure
Lecture videos for a week will be released on Monday and posted here.  Please take a look at them promptly!

The coursework will be 40% of the mark and the exam will be 60% (deadlines TBA).

TA led sessions on Thursday 3-5 are the main route for feedback on all aspects of the course: lectures, labs and coursework.  These will start on 11th Feb, and you will be assigned a group by email before then.  They will be hosted through the public Teams group [[grp-COMS20011_2020]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3af1eed314b79c436cac646c842b3dbd0b%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=aeff9e2c-6751-4dfe-a033-3c1e4244ffcf&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b) (if the link doesn't work, just search for "grp-COMS20011_2020").

There are lecturer-led Q&A sessions on Mondays at 4pm.  The first of these (Feb 1st) will be TA led, to help getting IT set up for labs.

There will be "lab" exercises released in the "lab" folder.  Please do them promptly and bring any questions to the TA-led sessions: the coursework is heavily based on the labs!
